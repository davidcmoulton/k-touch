{"name":"k-touch","tagline":"Providing the Konami code on touch devices.","body":"# k-touch\r\nNot content with a traditional Konami-code-activated easter egg on your site?\r\n\r\nTroubled that touch screen users are locked out of such geek essentials?\r\n\r\nThen your worries are over: here is some ***touch-enabled Konami code action***!\r\n\r\n## What it does\r\nkonami-touch provides touch-screen-actuated Konami code driven functionality, ***and*** additionally throws in the traditional keyboard-entered Konami code mechanism for extra fun.\r\n\r\nThis implementation plays audio using html5 audio.\r\n\r\nIf you're using it on a touch device, it also uses canvas.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n1. Copy the js, css and assets directories to your site;\r\n\r\n2. include a reference to k-code.js and k-code.css in your html file (see demo.html for an example);\r\n\r\n3. then either:\r\n\r\n    a. load your page in a desktop browser and enter the Konami code, or:\r\n\r\n    b. load your page on a touch-enabled device, and begin to swipe the Konami code. You should be given the facility to enter B and A at the right moment, assuming you've got it right up to that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where does it work? \r\nThis should work on all desktop browsers that support html5 audio.\r\n\r\nIt has also been tested sucessfully on:\r\n    \r\n+ Firefox on Android ICS & Jellybean\r\n\r\n+ Opera mobile (webkit version) on Android ICS & Jellybean\r\n\r\n+ Built in browser on Android ICS\r\n\r\n+ Dolphin browser on Android ICS & Jellybean\r\n\r\n+ Safari on iPad iOS 6\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where doesn't it work?\r\nThis won't work on browsers that don't support html5 audio (and canvas touch events, for touch devices). Polyfilled IE 8 hasn't been tested, so you'll have to try it and see. \r\n\r\nThis also doesn't currently work on Chrome on Android. The swipe guestures are received, but the touch event on the canvas B and A buttons isn't detected for reasons I haven't got to the bottom of yet.\r\n\r\nIt won't work on proxy browsers (Opera Mini and Dolphin Mini).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nCurrently this logs keycodes to the console, and records the swipe gestures and button presses received in-page within <code>div#debug</code>.\r\n\r\nIt also uses <code>div#msg</code> to indicate if touch support has been detected.\r\n\r\nThis could be improved by using some kind of formal logger, but that's not a priority. That said, if you want it to see it in, send me a pull request :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
