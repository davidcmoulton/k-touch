        <h1>
<a name="k-touch" class="anchor" href="#k-touch"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>k-touch</h1>

<p>Not content with a traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Konami_code_games">Konami-code</a>-activated easter egg on your site?</p>

<p>Troubled that touch screen users are locked out of such geek essentials?</p>

<p>Then your worries are over: here is some <strong><em>touch-enabled Konami code action!</em></strong></p>

<h2>
<a name="what-it-does" class="anchor" href="#what-it-does"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it does</h2>

<p>k-touch provides touch-screen-actuated Konami-code-driven functionality, <strong><em>and</em></strong> throws in the traditional keyboard-entered Konami code mechanism for extra fun.</p>

<p>This implentation plays audio using html5 audio.</p>

<p>If you're using it on a touch device, it also uses canvas. And touch events, obviously.</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-to-use-it" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use it</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Copy the js, css and assets directories to your site;</p></li>
<li><p>include a reference to k-code.js and k-code.css in your html file (see demo.html for an example);</p></li>
<li>
<p>then either:</p>

<p>a. load your page in a desktop browser and enter the Konami code, or:</p>

<p>b. load your page on a touch-enabled device, and begin to swipe the Konami code (swipe up for up... you get the idea). You should be given the facility to enter B and A at the right moment, assuming you've got it right up to that point.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Try this <a href="http://davidcmoulton.github.io/k-touch/demo.html">live demo</a>. (It will be a blank page if touch isn't supported; it will say "touch supported" and echo the touch to the screen if touch is supported.)</p>

<h2>
<a name="where-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#where-does-it-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where does it work?</h2>

<p>This should work on all desktop browsers that support html5 audio.</p>

<p>It has also been tested sucessfully on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Firefox on Android ICS &amp; Jellybean</p></li>
<li><p>Opera mobile (webkit version) on Android ICS &amp; Jellybean</p></li>
<li><p>Built in browser on Android ICS</p></li>
<li><p>Dolphin browser on Android ICS &amp; Jellybean</p></li>
<li><p>Safari on iPad iOS 6</p></li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="where-doesnt-it-work" class="anchor" href="#where-doesnt-it-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where doesn't it work?</h2>

<p>This won't work on browsers that don't support html5 audio (and canvas touch events, for touch devices). Polyfilled IE 8 hasn't been tested, so you'll have to try it and see. </p>

<p>This also doesn't currently work on Chrome on Android. The swipe gestures are received, but the touch event on the canvas B and A buttons isn't detected for reasons I haven't got to the bottom of yet.</p>

<p>It won't work on proxy browsers, like Opera Mini and Dolphin Mini.</p>

<h2>
<a name="notes" class="anchor" href="#notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes</h2>

<p>Currently this logs keycodes to the console, and records the swipe gestures and button presses received in-page within <code>div#debug</code>.</p>

<p>It also uses <code>div#msg</code> to indicate if touch support has been detected.</p>

<p>This hasn't been tested on devices that support both touch and have a keyboard, so I'll be interested to see how it works on, say, a Chromebook Pixel.</p>

<p>This could be improved by using some kind of formal logger, but that's not a priority. Actually, this could be improved in many ways, but it was built for fun :-) That said, if there's something specific you'd like to see in, fork it and send me a pull request :-)</p>
